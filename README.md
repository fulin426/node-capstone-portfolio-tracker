## Use Case
Portfolio Tracker is for the individual investor to keep track of all their assets in one place. Investments may be in different accounts such as a employer sponsored plan, a Roth IRA, a taxable account, CDs, or money market account. This will help them see the current state of their investments and the user will be better informed on which assets need adjustment.

## Functionality 
The user will individually add each asset including the name, current value, and target percentage that the user wants to maintain. After the target values add up to 100% they will be able to analyze their portofoio with the current percentage values side by side with target percentages. A pie chart will generate to help visualize each slice the asset takes up in the portfolio.
